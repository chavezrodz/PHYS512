        Problem 1

        Shifting Gaussian by 25 points,
        which translates to dx = 2.50.
        mean of gaussian is now at 2.5
        

        Problem 2

        Please find the plot in Results/q2.png

        

        Problem 3)

        By shifting the Gaussian, The correlation function also shifts,
        expectedly.
        

        Problem 4)

        If one input array is shorter than the other, we pad it 
        with zeros so that both arrays are the same length. The
        output we take is the size of the shorter array.

        
Input arrays of length 100 & 100

Input arrays of length 100 & 100
Padding both arrays by 3 on the ends

Input arrays of length 100 & 150
Different input arrays, padding one
Arrays now of lengths 150 & 150

Input arrays of length 100 & 150
Different input arrays, padding one
Arrays now of lengths 150 & 150
Padding both arrays by 3 on the ends


        Problem 5)

        Please find a) & b) in 5ab.pdf

        c)
        The Numerical FFT of the sine function agrees with our analytical
        FFT with average error -4.758e-15

        We have the two expected peaks at +/- k, however, the width of the delta functions
        is rather broad

        d)
        We define the window function, and plot the result in 5d.png.
        We note that the width of the delta function function decreases with windowing,
        reducing leakage.

        e)
        We show numerically that the FFT of the window function is [N/2, -N/4, 0, ..., -N/4]
        by comparing the numerical fft and the suggested array. We obtain the results to agree
        to machine precision, with average error -8.882e-18

        We show the demonstration of the windowed fft using the previous part in the attached
        image, then compare 
            -the fft of a windowed sine wave
            -the fft of an unwindowed sine wave, windowed using the suggested array
        Both methods agree to an average error 2.132e-01


        

        Problem 6)
        b)
        We fit the power spectrum of the random walk with 1/k^2
        and achieve an average error of 3.431e-02
