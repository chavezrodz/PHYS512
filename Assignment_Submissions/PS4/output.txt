        Problem 1

        For 2501 degrees of freedom,
        We have chi-squared values of 15267.938772724061 and 3272.203674313185
        for the test values and the new given values respectively.

        Given that the mean and variance of chi-squared is 
        2501 and 5002, a fit within one standard deviation would be
        2501 +- 70.7248188403477. Since both tested parameters have a 
        chi-squared value outside of this range, these are not a good fit.

        The new tested parameters have a chi-squared closer
        to the accepted value.

        Problem 2

        We fit the model using an LM fitter and export the paramaters along with
        the covariance matrix.

        We note that our new chi-squared value 2576.153 is much closer to the accepted value.

        Problem 3

        We fit the model using an MCMC with the covariance matrix from problem 2
        and export the chain to Results/planck_chain.csv

        We believe the chain has converged since it roughly stabilizes after
        about 150 steps, and the parameters plot with respect to steps look like noise
        after removing the burning period. Looking at the FFT of the parameters evolution,
        we also observe a flat region in the low frequencies, indicating convergence.
        These plots are produced in display.py and can be found in Results/chain/.

        Moreover, the average chis-squared value
        after removing the burning period is 2582.1+/-3.5, which is about one standard
        deviation close to the accepted value presented in problem one.

        After removing the burn-in period, we take the average of the values and 
        standard errors for the Hubble constant, the Baryon density and the
        Dark matter density. then solve for the dark energy.

        we find that 

        \Omega_\Lambda = 1 - (100/H_0)^2 (\Omega_C h^2 + \Omega_b h^2)

        which gives us \Omega_\Lambda = 0.700+/-0.012


        Problem 4
        We first compute the results by importance sampling our chain from
        question 3 and we find a value for 
        tau =  0.05599778348840123 +- 0.00824244030851979
        which is close to the prior value, as expected.

        The results for all other parameters are as follows:
        H0: 67.92812844011891 +- 0.938921130055884
        Ohmbh2: 0.022373134055725455 +- 0.00020895113689629478
        Ohmch2: 0.11844042830136989 +- 0.002147200453849252
        As: 2.0963721853332777e-09 +- 3.369059849030247e-11
        ns: 0.9716628013621034 +- 0.005409737908135587


        Using the same weights from importance sampling, we compute 
        the covariance matrix which we use in the new mcmc we run with
        tau prior knowledge.

        we then find the following values:

        H0: 67.6091941592047 +- 0.9764376518228244
        Ohmbh2: 0.02229627440193048 +- 0.00021350200067567622
        Ohmch2: 0.11915778920032613 +- 0.0022245534664059687
        Tau: 0.05558641896806612 +- 0.00725731871964207
        As: 2.0990442161658433e-09 +- 3.0614381590035615e-11
        ns: 0.9695901335849327 +- 0.005387245214991686

        While adding the tau prior to the mcmc yielded a tau value closer to
        prior, the value we obtained with importance sampling was close to
        the prior already. We also note that running the new chain with
        the prior yields an error for tau closer to the prior.
